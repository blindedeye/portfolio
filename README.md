# Jake's Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my work in C++. Feel free to explore the projects and reach out to me for any questions or collaborations.

## About Me

I am a Student at Colorado Mesa University. Pursuing a Bachelors of Science for Computer Science. I am particularly interested in software development, but definitely am open to other flavors/branches of Computer Science. I like to say that I am actively pursuing knowledge.
