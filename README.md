# Jake's Portfolio

Hello! This repository showcases a collection of my various projects within Computer Science.

## About Me

I am a Student at Colorado Mesa University. Pursuing a Bachelors of Science for Computer Science. I am particularly interested in software development, but definitely am open to other flavors/branches of Computer Science. I like to say that I am actively pursuing knowledge.

## Projects

1. [Python P2P Messaging App](#python-peer-to-peer-messaging-app)
2. [Calorie Tracker Program](#calorie-tracker-program)
3. [Trameaux Maze Traversal](#trameaux-maze-traversal-algorithm)
4. [Hangman Game](#hangman-game)

## Python Peer-to-Peer Messaging App
[Link to Program]()

**Description:** Program uses the peer-to-peer technique to connect nodes to each other for messaging each other.

**Highlighted Features**
- Universally Unique Identifier (UUID): Used so users can have the same name
- Automatic Peer Detection: Used so users don't have to input a specific ip/port
- Multicasting: Used to broadcast presence and discover peers
- Threaded Message Handling: Allows the system to process/send/receive messages simultaneously

## Calorie Tracker Program
[Link to Program](programs/calorieTracker/)

**Description** Program designed for a user to create an account and track caloric consumption.

**Highlighted Features**
- Client-End User Creation
- FileIO Saving

## Trameaux Maze Traversal Algorithm
[Link to Project](algorithms/trameauxMazeTraversal/)

**Description** Program uses a Trameaux Traversal Backtracking Algorithm to solve a 2D maze.

**Highlighted Features**
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Trameaux Backtracking Algorithm
- Maze Solving

**Description**

**Highlighted Features**
- FileIO Word Bank
- Add/Remove Words
