# üßë‚Äçüíª Jake Peterson - Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I‚Äôm a CS student at Colorado Mesa University, with interests in software engineering, cloud development, and logic-based problem solving. In this portfolio, you‚Äôll see highlights of my work, ranging from personal projects to academic assignments.<br><br>

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### [Banking App](./projects/oop-final-fa24/README.md)
A full-stack, mock banking application. Using Flask for a python-based backend, Postgres for the database (running locally), and regular HTML/CSS/JS frontend. Application was developed using Object-Oriented Design patterns. 

Project members:

Jake Peterson (Me) -> Backend Logic (setting up flask app/routes, linking frontend to backend, and implementation of hashing)

Colin McArthur -> Frontend (making clean templates with proper styling and JS logic, setup temp routes to assist my logic development)

Carlos Ortiz -> Database (setup the Postgres database and tables)

**Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, Postgres

**Highlights**:
- Password Hashing
- Database
- Clean User Interface
- User Authentication
- Error Handling (overdraws, rollbacks, account validation, etc.)
- Multiple Bank Account Types
- User Roles (user, admin w/ admin page)
- Internal & External Transfer Capabilities
- Transaction History (with filtering functionality)
- Modular design

### [Weather App](./projects/weather_app/)
A basic, Python-based, weather app using Textual for a clean command-line interface. Features rich formatting, live weather data updates, and object oriented code structure.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Textual, OpenWeather API  

**Highlights**:
- Real-time weather data using Textual
- Modular design and rich formatting for clear visuals

---

### [Personal Budget Tracker](./projects/budget_tracker/README.md)
A full-stack budgeting web-app that helps users track income and expenses. Docker-based setup for easy deployment. Assignment from Computer Languages, Fall 2024.

**Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL, Docker, React, Node.js  

**Highlights**:
- Integrated Docker setup for easy deployment
- Database-backed budgeting and analytics

## üìÇ Additional Projects

- **Terminal Peer-to-Peer Messaging App** ([Link](./projects/p2pApp/)) - Program that uses the peer-to-peer technique to connect nodes to each other for sending messages to each other. Uses Universally Unique Identifier's for duplicate names (common in chatrooms), automatic peer detection so users don't have to input a specific ip/port, multicasting for broadcasting presence/discovery of peers, and threaded message handling so the system can process/send/receive messages simultaneously.
- **Terminal Calorie Tracker** ([Link](https://github.com/your-username/distributed_computing_presentation)) - Program designed for a user to create an account and track caloric consumption. Demonstrated my understanding of object oriented programming and certain data structures for CS2: Data Structures class.
- **Terminal Hangman Game** ([C++](./projects/hangman_cpp/)) ([Python](./projects/hangman_python/)) - Basic game of hangman in user terminal. Completed at the end of my first semester at CMU, and later created in Python for fun. Involves guessing letters in a randomly chosen word.
- **Resizing Stack and Queue Data Structures** ([Stack](./projects/resizing_stackqueue/resizingStack.h)) ([Queue](./projects/resizing_stackqueue/resizingQueue.h)) - Self-resizing data structure libraries/headers created for CS3: Intro to Algorithms class. Was not allowed to use external libraries for projects, so created these to use essential data structures for specific projects.
- **Trameaux Maze Traversal Algorithm** ([link](./projects/trameauxMazeTraversal/)) - Program that uses a Trameaux Traversal Backtracking Algorithm to solve 2D mazes. Uses dynamic memory allocation, a trameaux backtracking algorithm, and maze-solving theory.
